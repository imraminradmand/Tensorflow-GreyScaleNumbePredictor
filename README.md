# Tensorflow-GreyScaleNumbePredictor
Model that will predict what number is in an image - CNN

# Dataset
Data that the model is being trained, and getting its test data is the MNIST dataset.
Provides enough data for a good train/test split.

# What model does
From the repo's name you can probably guess it. Give an image of a number between 0 - 9 model can predict what number is in the image.
Pretty simple :)
